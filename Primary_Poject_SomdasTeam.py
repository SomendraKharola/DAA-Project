This project's analysis, conducted with a verified algorithm, provides a
comprehensive, data-driven summary of the structural integrity of several
major real-world networks. The findings from each experimental phase are
detailed below.

**Benchmark and Density Analysis**
The algorithm's correctness was first established through a rigorous testing
suite. On all basic test graphs, results were a PASS. Further validation was
performed against a suite of standard benchmark graphs with known properties.
The algorithm successfully identified the extreme fragility of **Path graphs**
(finding n-2 articulation points and n-1 bridges) and **Star graphs** (finding 1
central articulation point and k bridges). Conversely, it confirmed the
resilience of **Complete graphs**, **Cycle graphs**, and **Wheel graphs**, correctly
reporting 0 critical points for each. Crucially, when tested against the
**Petersen graph**—a well-known biconnected benchmark—the algorithm also
correctly identified **0 articulation points** and **0 bridges**. This
comprehensive testing across diverse topologies confirms the algorithm's accuracy.

The density analysis demonstrated that for a 50-node random graph, weak spots
diminish rapidly with connectivity. A sparse graph with 49 edges (density
0.040) had numerous bridges, but this number dropped to **0** by the time the
graph reached a density of just 0.090, confirming that even modest
redundancy drastically improves resilience.

**Real-World Network Analysis and Performance**
The runtime of the algorithm scaled linearly with network size, as expected,
validating its O(n+m) complexity and confirming its suitability for large-scale
analysis. The criticality of the identified points was explicitly verified:
removing a single bridge or articulation point from any of the tested networks
was shown to increase the number of its disconnected components. For example,
the 'roadNet-PA.txt' graph, which started with 206 disconnected parts, split
into **207 parts** after removing one bridge and **208 parts** after removing one
articulation point. This provides concrete proof of their function.

The results revealed three distinct classes of network structures:

1.  **Road Networks:** These were found to be extremely fragile. The
    'roadNet-CA.txt' dataset yielded **327,864 articulation points** and
    **376,517 bridges**. The high ratio of critical points to total nodes and
    edges confirms a topology dominated by single-point failures.

2.  **Internet Networks:** These proved far more resilient. The 'as-skitter.txt'
    graph, despite having over 1.6 million nodes, contained **111,541
    articulation points**. While large, this number is proportionally much
    lower than in road networks, which points to a robust core with many
    redundant paths.

3.  **Electrical Power Grids:** These networks were the most vulnerable. The
    'power-US-Grid.txt' dataset, with only 4,941 nodes, had **1,229
    articulation points** and **1,611 bridges**. The high number of bridges
    relative to its small size demonstrates a heavy dependence on single
    transmission lines, making it structurally prone to outages.
