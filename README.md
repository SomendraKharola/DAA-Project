Hello!

1. Ensure you have downloaded the following six datasets in this GitHub repository into a particular folder. The six datasets are: "as20000102.txt", "as-skitter.txt", "power_grid_uci.txt", "power-US-Grid.txt", "roadNet-CA.txt", "roadNet-PA.txt". 
2. "as-skitter.txt" is not uploaded to GitHub repository given its size. Please download it form here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/as-Skitter.html
3. "roadNet-CA.txt" is not uploaded to GitHub repository given its size. Please download it form here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-CA.html
5. "roadNet-PA.txt" is not uploaded to GitHub repository given its size. Please download it form here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-PA.html

2. Furthermore, please do download the following files as well from this GitHub repository: "Primary_Somda'sTeam.py", "Primary_Somda'sTeam.pdf", "ProjectSubmission_SomdasTeam.py", "ProjectSubmission_SomdasTeam_Output.pdf", "DAA_Project_SomdasTeam.pdf". Download these files in the same folder where the above 6 datasets were downloaded.
3. To view the source code for the primary objective -- i.e. the 3 tasks and 3 experiments -- please view file titled "Primary_Somda'sTeam.py", and run it. All the test sets are embedded into the code, and their attributes detailed in the report -- titled ""DAA_Project_SomdasTeam.pdf". Thus no need to input any test sets. The same code also reads the above 6 datasets, and thus no need to input them either.
4. To view the output of "Primary_Somda'sTeam.py" please view "Primary_Somda'sTeam.pdf".
5. To view the code for the secondary objective -- i.e the sub-project wherein we discuss "Finding Crucial Connections in a Power Grid Whose Failure Would Split the System" -- please view "ProjectSubmission_SomdasTeam.py".
6. To view the output of "ProjectSubmission_SomdasTeam.py" please view "ProjectSubmission_SomdasTeam_Output.pdf".
7. To view the project report please view "DAA_Project_SomdasTeam.pdf".
