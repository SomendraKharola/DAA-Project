DAA Project
1. Ensure you have copied and pasted the following 6 datasets into a suitable location. The 6 datasets are: as20000102.txt, as-skitter.txt, power_grid_uci.txt, power-US-Grid.txt, roadNet-CA.txt, roadNet-PA.txt 
2. To view the code for the primary objective -- i.e. the 3 tasks and 3 experiments -- please view file titled "graph_analysis_backup.py", and run it. All the test sets are embedded into the code, and their attributes detailed in the report. Thus no need to input any test sets. The same code also inputs the above 6 datasets by reading the associated files.
4. To view the output of "graph_analysis_backup.py" please view "graph_analysis_backup_SomdasTeam_Output.pdf".
3. To view the code for the secondary objective -- i.e the sub-project wherein we discuss "Finding Crucial Connections in a Power Grid Whose Failure Would Split the System" please view "ProjectSubmission_SomdasTeam.py".
