Hello!

1. Ensure you have downloaded the following six datasets in this GitHub repository into a particular folder. The six datasets are: "as20000102.txt", "as-skitter.txt", "power_grid_uci.txt", "power-US-Grid.txt", "roadNet-CA.txt", "roadNet-PA.txt", "test.txt".
2. "as-skitter.txt" is not uploaded to the GitHub repository given its LARGE SIZE. Please download it form here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/as-Skitter.html
3. "roadNet-CA.txt" is not uploaded to the GitHub repository given its LARGE SIZE. Please download it form here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-CA.html
4. "roadNet-PA.txt" is not uploaded to the GitHub repository given its LARGE SIZE. Please download it form here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-PA.html
5. Furthermore, please do download the following files as well from this GitHub repository: "Primary_Project_SomdasTeam.py", "Primary_Project_SomdasTeam.pdf", "Project_Report_SomdasTeam.py", "Secondary_Project_SomdasTeam_Output.pdf", "Secondary_Project_SomdasTeam.py". Download these files in the same folder where the above 6 datasets were downloaded.
6. To view the **source code for the primary objective**-- i.e. the 3 tasks and 3 experiments -- please view file titled "Primary_Project_SomdasTeam.py", and run it. All the test sets are embedded into the code, and their attributes detailed in the complete project report -- titled "Project_Report_SomdasTeam. pdf". Thus no need to input any test sets. The same code also reads the above 6 datasets, and thus no need to explictly input them either.

**PLEASE, KINDLY NOTE: "test.txt" is a test file created by us to test the code. "Primary_Project_SomdasTeam.py" reads it from the file when downloaded to a folder, as mentioned in point 1.**
   
8. To view the output of "Primary_Project_SomdasTeam.py" please view "Primary_Project_SomdasTeam.pdf".
9. To **view the code for the secondary objective (the SUB-PROJECT)** -- i.e the sub-project wherein we discuss "Finding Crucial Connections in a Power Grid Whose Failure Would Split the System" -- please view "Secondary_Project_SomdasTeam.py".
10. To view the output of "Secondary_Project_SomdasTeam.py" please view "Secondary_Project_SomdasTeam_Output.pdf".
11. **To view the COMPLETE PROJECT REPORT please view "Project_Report_SomdasTeam.pdf"**.

Thank you!

All good wishes,
