Hello!

1. Ensure you have downloaded the following six datasets in this GitHub repository into a particular folder. The six datasets are: "as20000102.txt", "as-skitter.txt", "power_grid_uci.txt", "power-US-Grid.txt", "roadNet-CA.txt", "roadNet-PA.txt", and the one other small-network "test.txt".
2. "as-skitter.txt" is not uploaded to the GitHub repository given its LARGE SIZE. Please download it form here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/as-Skitter.html
3. "roadNet-CA.txt" is not uploaded to the GitHub repository given its LARGE SIZE. Please download it form here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-CA.html
4. "roadNet-PA.txt" is not uploaded to the GitHub repository given its LARGE SIZE. Please download it form here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-PA.html
5. Furthermore, please do download the following files as well from this GitHub repository: "Primary_Project_SomdasTeam.py", "Primary_Project_SomdasTeam.pdf", "Project_Report_SomdasTeam.pdf", "Secondary_Project_SomdasTeam_Output.pdf", "Secondary_Project_SomdasTeam.py". Download these files in the same folder where the above 6 datasets were downloaded.
6. To view the **source code for the primary objective**-- i.e. the 3 tasks and 3 experiments -- please view file titled "Primary_Project_SomdasTeam.py", and run it. 
**PLEASE, KINDLY NOTE: "test.txt" is a test file created by us to test the code. "Primary_Project_SomdasTeam.py" reads it from the file when downloaded to a folder, as mentioned in point 1.**
   
8. To view the output of "Primary_Project_SomdasTeam.py" please view "Primary_Project_SomdasTeam.pdf".
9. To **view the code for the secondary objective (the SUB-PROJECT)** -- i.e the sub-project wherein we discuss "Finding Crucial Connections in a Power Grid Whose Failure Would Split the System" -- please view "Secondary_Project_SomdasTeam.py".
10. To view the output of "Secondary_Project_SomdasTeam.py" please view "Secondary_Project_SomdasTeam_Output.pdf".
11. **To view the COMPLETE PROJECT REPORT please view "Project_Report_SomdasTeam.pdf"**.
12. For the sub-project, we used variants of the primary source code, titled "Secondary-Project-SomdasTeam.py", which are mere improvisations of the same, and hence are not shared. However, the primary source code is shared on the GITHUB repository. Nevertheless, the outputs of those variants are shared on the GITHUB repository. They are titled: "Average-Fragmentation-Vs-AP-Multipoint Attack.pdf" and "Trial-Runs-10-AP-Multipoint Attack.pdf"

Thank you!

All good wishes,
